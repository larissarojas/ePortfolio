# Software Design and Engineering

The artifact I selected for this milestone is my weight tracking Android app, which I first created in CS 360, around 6 months ago. It allows users to log in, enter daily weight entries, set a goal weight and track their progress. The app also includes features for editing and deleting past entries and even sends SMS notifications when the goal weight is reached. It uses a SQLite database to store user accounts and weight history. I chose this app for my ePortfolio because it represents my skills in software design and engineering in a very hands on way. It shows that I can build a complete mobile application from scratch, connect it to a database, design a user interface and add interactive features. This artifact highlights several skills that are important for my future career, like handling user input, working with data storage, designing clean layouts, and implementing logic for real world needs.

For this milestone, I performed multiple enhancements to improve the app:

•	I added better input validation so that only numbers can be entered for weight and goal weight and I added realistic limits to prevent invalid entries.

•	I improved the user interface design, such as styling the Delete and Edit buttons with correct text size and custom colors (blue and pink) to make them more professional and easier to see.

•	I added spacing between weight entries in the RecyclerView so that the layout looks cleaner.

•	I customized the color scheme of the app to pink as my primary theme which gives it a consistent, polished look.

•	The most important enhancement I added was a progress bar with a percentage label that shows how close the user is to reaching their goal weight. This makes the app more engaging and useful by giving visual feedback on progress.

These enhancements made the app more reliable, user friendly and professional.

The main outcome I worked on here was software engineering and design. By adding new features like the progress bar and improving the UI and input validation, I demonstrated my ability to use good design practices and tools to deliver a better product. I also touched on the security mindset outcome by making sure input is validated so the app can’t crash or behave incorrectly when users type invalid values. I believe these changes align with the outcomes I planned in the previous modules and I feel I am on track to show competency.

Through this enhancement process, I learned how small changes, like adjusting layout constraints or adding margins, can make a big difference in the usability and look of an app. I also practiced how to organize new features into existing code without breaking the flow of the program. One of the challenges I faced was placing the progress label in the right spot so it wasn’t overlapping or hidden, it took some trial and error with margins and constraints to get it right. Another challenge was making sure the new features, like the progress bar, updated correctly when weights were entered. I also realized that software design is never really “finished.” There are always small details I could improve. For example, in the future I want to make sure the progress bar saves and reloads correctly when a user logs back in. For now though I am satisfied that I completed the biggest and most important enhancements for this milestone.

Overall I believe this milestone demonstrates strong progress toward the software design and engineering outcome. My artifact now looks more polished, handles user input more safely, and provides a better experience through added features like the progress bar and improved color scheme. All planned enhancements were successfully completed and tested, and the app now performs smoothly without major issues. This process helped me grow my skills in Android development, UI design and database integration. I am proud of the final result and confident that this completed version fully demonstrates my abilities in software design and engineering.
