# Algorithms and Data Structure

For this milestone I chose my hash table project from CS 300, completed last semester. The goal of that assignment was to build a program that can load thousands of bids from a CSV file and store them in a hash table so the user can quickly search, remove, or display bids. The project taught me how to turn a string ID into a numeric key, handle collisions with a linked list, and manage memory safely. It was one of my first chances to really apply data structures for speed and efficiency instead of just making code run.

I selected this hash table because it clearly shows my skills in algorithms and data structures. In CS 300 I also worked on vector sorting (selection and quicksort), but for my ePortfolio I decided to focus on the hash table because it’s a stronger, clearer example of algorithmic design and data structure use. While improving the code, I added better comments to explain each method, added a small check when loading CSV rows to avoid crashes on bad input, and reviewed the search/insert logic to make sure collisions are handled safely. These changes make the artifact easier to read, safer to run, and a better demonstration of my problem solving skills.

This artifact helps meet the outcome about using algorithmic principles to solve problems and produce efficient, correct code. My original plan from Module One was to improve the hash table’s reliability and clarity. I have done that by adding more comments, cleaning up variable names and adding input checks. I had thought about also adding sorting comparisons, but I chose to keep the focus on the hash table itself so the artifact is clear and shows depth rather than being spread too thin.

While improving the hash table, I faced some small challenges. I had to think about memory safety when deleting nodes and be sure user input for bidId wouldn’t break the program. I overcame this by testing small parts of the code and reviewing class examples. Writing new comments forced me to really understand the flow of each method. This experience made me more confident about designing maintainable and efficient data structures and about documenting my work so anyone can follow my code and understand it clearly. I am proud of the final version of this hash table, which now runs safely, reads clearly and demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic principles to real world problems.
