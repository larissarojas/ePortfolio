## Professional Self Assessment
Looking back at my time in the Computer Science program, I can really see how much I have grown. When I started I barely understood code and needed a lot of practice to figure things out. Over time, through different classes and projects, I learned how to actually apply programming skills and solve problems step by step. Now I can look at real code, understand what it does and make improvements to it with confidence. My goal moving forward is to keep learning and become faster and more comfortable writing and fixing code so I can handle real life tasks and projects quickly at my future jobs.

One of my biggest strengths is that I am very tech savvy and naturally curious about how things work. I love learning about new technology, and I’ve truly enjoyed everything I learned in this program. Each course taught me something new that built on what I already knew. For example, my three main artifacts, the Weight Tracking Android App, the Hash Table Project, and the Animal Shelter MongoDB Dashboard, all show a clear path of improvement. I went from following simple tutorials to building, debugging, and improving full programs that actually work.

The program also helped me develop my teamwork and communication skills. Through discussion posts, I connected with other students, shared ideas and learned to see problems from different perspectives. It taught me how to explain my thought process clearly and how to listen to feedback, which are both important skills when working in technology or collaborating with a team. I also grew a lot in understanding data structures and algorithms, especially from my Hash Table project. It showed me how important efficiency and logic are in programming. From the Weight Tracking App, I learned about software design and engineering, creating something user friendly, fixing errors and improving features. And from the Animal Shelter MongoDB project, I gained experience working with databases, managing real data and making my code more secure and reliable. Across all these projects, I practiced writing better code, documenting my work and thinking about how a program should run safely without errors.

Another important lesson I learned was developing a security mindset. In my projects, I made sure user input was validated and the code handled errors safely. These steps might seem small, but they help protect the system and keep data secure, which is something I now always think about when writing code. Overall this program helped me become more confident, skilled and professional in computer science. I’ve learned how to think critically, test my ideas and improve my work until it’s the best it can be. My ePortfolio shows this growth clearly, from the early stages of learning to code to creating projects that demonstrate real technical skills. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to keep improving so I can reach my career goals in the technology field.
