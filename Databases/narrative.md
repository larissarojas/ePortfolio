# Databases

For my databases category, I chose my CS 340 MongoDB Animal Shelter project. This artifact was part of my CS 340 course in December 2024 where I built a CRUD module (AnimalShelter.py) and an interactive dashboard to work with animal data stored in MongoDB. It was one of my first real experiences connecting a Python application to a database and then using that data in a user friendly way. The dashboard shows animal information in a table, a pie chart for breeds, and a map to view locations. I created it because it was a practical way to apply what I was learning about databases and data visualization.

I included this artifact in my ePortfolio because it shows my ability to connect, query, and manage data in MongoDB, which is an essential skill in many IT and software jobs. For this enhancement I focused on making the database code more professional and reliable. I added indexing to improve query performance, especially when filtering by rescue type. I also added better error handling so the app doesn’t crash if something unexpected happens. In the AnimalShelter class, I cleaned up the CRUD methods with clear return values and simple, useful comments. These improvements make the system faster, safer and easier to maintain.

I’m meeting the database outcomes I planned at the start of the course. My original goal was to show that I can create and interact with a NoSQL database and use it in an application. Now with indexing and better query structure, my artifact is closer to something that could be used in a real workplace setting. I also explored additional ways to improve the dashboard, such as adding more filters, search options and user role ideas for database security. These updates show that I’m thinking beyond basic functionality toward professional level database management.

The process taught me how small changes can make a big difference in database performance and user experience. One challenge I faced was making sure my updates didn’t break the existing dashboard, I wanted to keep everything working while improving the back end. Testing each change step by step helped me feel confident. I also realized how important it is to write clear comments. Overall this artifact now shows my growth with databases. I went from just storing and showing data to optimizing it and thinking about real world reliability. It’s a strong piece for my ePortfolio because it shows both technical skill and my ability to keep improving a project.
